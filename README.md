‚úÖ 1. Download GloVe Embeddings
You can download GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) from the official Stanford NLP site:

üîó https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

‚ö†Ô∏è The total ZIP file is around 822 MB, so make sure you have a good internet connection.

‚úÖ 2. Extract the ZIP File
After downloading:

Right-click on glove.6B.zip

Select ‚ÄúExtract All‚Ä¶‚Äù

You‚Äôll get the following .txt files:

glove.6B.50d.txt

glove.6B.100d.txt

glove.6B.200d.txt

glove.6B.300d.txt ‚úÖ (we will use this one)

‚úÖ 3. Convert GloVe to Word2Vec Format
GloVe format is not directly compatible with Gensim, so we need to convert it using a built-in Gensim utility.

Here‚Äôs how:

python

from gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec import glove2word2vec

# Paths
glove_input_file = "glove.6B.300d.txt"
word2vec_output_file = "glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt"

# Convert
glove2word2vec(glove_input_file, word2vec_output_file)
This will create the file glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt in the same directory ‚Äî now Gensim can load it!

‚úÖ 4. Load the Converted File in Your App
You can now load the .word2vec.txt file like this:

python

from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format("glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt", binary=False)
‚úÖ 5. Use It to Find Similar Words
python

model.most_similar("cricket", topn=5)
Example output:

[('batsman', 0.74), ('match', 0.72), ('innings', 0.68), ...]
üß† Tips for Smooth Usage
Keep the GloVe .txt files inside a models/ folder to stay organized.

Add glove.6B.300d.word2vec.txt to .gitignore if it's large and already available online.
