🚀 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞: 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐀𝐩𝐩 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐝𝟐𝐕𝐞𝐜 & 𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐕𝐞 🔍🧠

I'm excited to share my latest NLP-based project where I built a web application that calculates semantic similarity between words using two powerful techniques:
➡ Custom-trained Word2Vec model
➡ Pre-trained GloVe embeddings

💡 The app allows users to enter a word and instantly view the top similar words based on vector semantics — all through a user-friendly interface powered by Flask.

🧠 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐃𝐢𝐝:

Built a Flask-based web app for real-time word similarity predictions

Trained a custom Word2Vec model using a structured corpus (including cricket-related vocabulary ⚾)

Integrated GloVe (300d) pre-trained vectors for comparison

Designed a clean and simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

Handled dynamic rendering with Jinja2 templates
